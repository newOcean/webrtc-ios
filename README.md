webRTC iOS example app.

Forked from newOcean.  Updated to the latest webrtc iOS example code from google.  Not sure the trunk directory is needed.

To Run example:

- Build this code for a device (iPad or iPhone).
- Open a Google Chrome browser (not IE, Firefox or Safari - spent a day debugging why Firefox was not working - CHROME!!)
- Open this URL: https://apprtc.appspot.com
- Ensure the camera on your laptop has an image
- Make note of the room number in the URL after loading web page
- Run the iOS app and type in the room number
- Stand back .... Should here feedback audio between your laptop and iOS device.
- NOTE - the audio is the only channel implemented by Google, the video render portion on iOS is not implemented yet.


UPDATE 11/14/13:
- Video support added!
- Now video and audio are both full duplex
- Code is not ideal, needs to be cleaned up, to repeat, CODE IS A HACK and needs clean up
- Big thanks to [Bridger Maxwell] (http://www.bridgermaxwell.com) for the webRTC objC video code - totally could not be done without his help, THANK YOU!
- This [thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/discuss-webrtc/vBD_A7gY9Io/I5YFux--6HgJ) on google groups was VERY, VERY helpful
- These libraries are the key to bringing video to life:
    - ios-example/libs/libjingle.a
    - ios-example/libs/libjingle_media.a
    - ios-example/libs/libjingle_peerconnection_objc.a
    - ios-example/libs/libvideo_render_module.a

To build XCode iOS app only for device (not simulator):
- project location: webrtc-ios/ios-example/AppRTCDemo.xcodeproj 
- Open the XCode project and set target for iPad / iPhone
- Build and run
- Should work without changes
(webrtc branch 3.46)

To build the video and jingle libs yourself, which you can then copy back into the ios-example/libs directory:
- Download a copy of the Google WebRTC build tools and code [here](http://www.webrtc.org/reference/getting-started)
    (webrtc branch 3.46)
- Copy the files in the webrtc_obj dir into this dir ...projdir.../trunk/talk/app/webrtc/objc
- Build the AppRTCDemo target: wrios && gclient runhooks && ninja -C out_ios/Debug AppRTCDemo
- Copy the resulting libs back into the Xcode project
      cp ...projdir.../trunk/out_ios/Debug/libvideo_render_module.a ...projdir.../ios_app/webrtc-ios/ios-example/libs
- I am not using the trunk dir provided in this repo.  Using the Google trunk that you downloaded in step one instead. 

Update 4/29/14:
 - iOS7, Mavericks, and XCode 5.1 update!!
 - Ensured my local repo was in sync with github
 - Set SDK and target device to 7.1
 - Compiled and saw over 100+ errors
 - Determined that "Other Linker Flags" needed to be set to:
       "-stdlib=libstdc++"
 - fixed all 100+ errors
 - URL for stun server in JSON key changed from URL to URLS, so changed parser
 - Ran client SW on my iPhone5 running 7.1
 - Worked!

My Test setup as of 4/29/14:
- MacBook Pro wih OSX 10.9.2
- Chrome browser connected to apprtc.appspot.com
- iPhone5 (iOS7) connected to Xcode 5.1 via debugger
- Occasionaly, I hit an issue with the TURN server not being reachable and need to re-run the app.  Some networks this is worse, e.g. home network versus work.

Again, this code needs a lot of cleanup, so please use at own risk.  Enjoy!
